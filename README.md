# shallow_planning_partial_observability
## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for the project "Shallow Planning under Partial Observability". The project explores various planning algorithms and their performance in environments with partial observability.

## Files

### requirements.txt
This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the code in this repository. The dependencies include:
- `numpy`: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- `matplotlib`: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- `pymdptoolbox`: A Python library for Markov Decision Processes (MDP) tools.
- `joblib`: A set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shallow_planning_partial_observability.git
   cd shallow_planning_partial_observability
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the code and explore the results:
   Each Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file contains the code for a specific experiment. To run an experiment, open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. You can start Jupyter Notebook with the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to the desired .ipynb file and run the cells sequentially to execute the experiment.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your needs. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please open an issue on GitHub.
